The GRU model, trained to predict stress-strain response and energy absorption, uses eight discrete parameters to characterize the design space. It efficiently predicts new design responses in 0.16 milliseconds, enabling the rapid performance evaluation of 128,000 designs any given strain rate and final strain.
